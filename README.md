# 100 Most Frequent Words

A mini project aiming to set up web pages containing the 100 most frequent words for different languages.

Features include:

1. Examples of use for each word in the form of short, simple sentences.
2. A (cumulative) percentage indicating roughly how much of a language you cover if you know all the words up to the given word.
3. A pretty slick design!
