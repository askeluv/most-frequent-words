# 100 Most Frequent Words

A mini project aiming to set up web pages containing the 100 most frequent words for different languages. Currently it's designed to be lightweight, fetching data directly from online frequency lists, meaning that no data is stored locally. This also means that data is scraped every time the page is loaded, which of course is really slow!

The next steps are to:

1. Make a good-looking design using impress.js
2. Replace loading from websites with local data files to speed up load times
3. Add useful content about individual words

Here's the site in action: [100 Most Frequent  Words](http://projects.svanevik.me/most-frequent-words)
